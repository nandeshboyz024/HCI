# Vision IT Solutions Mobile App

Welcome to the Vision IT Solutions Mobile App repository! This project is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, leveraging modern technologies for both frontend and backend development. Below are the instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into two main directories:

1. **EyeOn**: Contains the frontend codebase.
2. **Backend**: Contains the backend codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)
- Expo CLI (for frontend development)

## Setting Up the Frontend (EyeOn)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vision-it-solutions.git
   cd vision-it-solutions/EyeOn
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    npm install
3. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
    npx expo start

#### This will start the Expo development server, and you can run the app on an emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd vision-it-solutions/Backend

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    npm install
   
3. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
    npm run dev

This will start the backend server, and it will be ready to handle requests from the frontend.
