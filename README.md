# Vision IT Solutions Mobile App

Welcome to the Vision IT Solutions Mobile App repository! This project is designed to provide a seamless experience for users, leveraging modern technologies for both frontend and backend development. Below are the instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into two main directories:

1. **EyeOn**: Contains the frontend codebase.
2. **Backend**: Contains the backend codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)
- Expo CLI (for frontend development)

## Setting Up the Frontend (EyeOn)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nandeshboyz024/HCI.git
   cd HCI/EyeOn
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Download Expo Go**:
   - To run the app on your mobile device, download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
   - Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools to open the app on your mobile device.

This will start the Expo development server, and you can run the app on an emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd HCI/Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the backend server, and it will be ready to handle requests from the frontend.
